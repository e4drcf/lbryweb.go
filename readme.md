# LBRY on the Web

The LBRY experience, in the comfort of your own browser.

Active development is in progress, expect failing tests and breaking changes.

## Running with Docker (easy)

Make sure you have Docker and docker-compose installed.

Then run:

```
docker-compose up app
```

_Warning: this will pull and launch lbrynet image, which lbryweb requires to operate_

After everything is done launching, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

#### If you would like to run off the source

You're still going to need lbrynet, so prefix your `go` commangs with docker stuff.

```
docker-compose up lbrynet --no-start
docker-compose start lbrynet && export LW_LBRYNET=http://localhost:5579/
go mod download
go generate ./...
make embed
LW_DEBUG=1 go run *.go serve
```

## Testing

Make sure you got `lbrynet` container running and run `make test`.

## Modifying and building a Docker image

First, make sure you have Go 1.11+

- Ubuntu: https://launchpad.net/~longsleep/+archive/ubuntu/golang-backports or https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Ubuntu
- OSX: `brew install go`

Then build the binary, create a docker image locally and run off it:

```
make image && docker-compose up app
```
